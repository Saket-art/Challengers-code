Problem Statement-

Tricon employees do not have access to details of what other employees are working on, they don't have a clear platform to look into which technologies other teams at Tricon working with, and also they don't have a clear idea about who are having experience in respective technologies so that any one who has issues they should approach HR every time.

To solve all these problems we have come up with a solution of Project Hub. The name itself says it's a hub where it includes all the project details along with the employee skills who are working on it, the workflow, the technologies used.
